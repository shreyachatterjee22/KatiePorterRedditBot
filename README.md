# Political Bots for Representative Katie Porter

## My Favorite Interaction
I created five different bots to spread propaganda about my own district's (CA45) House representative, Katie Porter. Running the bot gave me outputs like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r2rc5m/comment/hm6w096/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

This is my favorite interaction because its just so random. None of the comments are remotely related to each other. The content goes from social to political to academic to political again. 

## My Bot Outputs
Below is the output from running my bot1.py file

        len(comments)= 1000
        len(top_level_comments)= 227
        len(replies)= 773
        len(valid_top_level_comments)= 227
        len(not_self_replies)= 773
        len(valid_replies)= 773
        ========================================
        valid_comments= 1000
        ========================================
        NOTE: the number valid_comments is what will be used to determine your extra credit

I also ran 4 additional bots. Here are the outputs for those as well

bot2.py gives this output:

        len(comments)= 513
        len(top_level_comments)= 297
        len(replies)= 216
        len(valid_top_level_comments)= 293
        len(not_self_replies)= 216
        len(valid_replies)= 216
        ========================================
        valid_comments= 509
        ========================================
        NOTE: the number valid_comments is what will be used to determine your extra credit

bot3.py gives this output:
'''code'''

bot4.py gives this output:
'''code'''

bot5.py gives this output:
'''code'''

## Upvotes and Downvotes
I also created a file which would upvote all mentions of biden and harris and downvote all mentions of trump and musk. Here is the output of running that file: 

![Up/Downvote Counts](https://github.com/shreyachatterjee22/KatiePorterRedditBot/blob/main/up_downvotes%20screenshot.JPG)

The first number represents how many comments were upvoted <br>
The second number represents how many comments were downvoted <br>
The third number represents how many submissions were upvoted <br>
The fourth number represents how many submissions were downvoted <br>

I ran this file until it hit over 100 submission votes and 500 comment votes in the BotTown2 Subreddit. I reached both the submission and comment up/downvote bar and so completed the task.

## Calculating Points

Completing bot.py tasks = 18 points <br>

Getting at least 100 valid comments posted = 2 points <br>
